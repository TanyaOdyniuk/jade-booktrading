Mavenized version of the JADE Book Trading example
==================================================

This repository contains the Mavenized sources of the Book Trading
example of the JADE multi-agent platform. They haven't been changed
much beyond that, except for fixing a few warnings here and there.
As the rest of JADE, they're under the LGPL license.

Usage
-----

To try JADE with this example, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and run the main agent container with

       ./start-main-container.sh

   The GUI for the JADE remote monitor agent should pop up. You don't
   really need to do anything else with it, but it offers a lot of
   interesting information.

   Leave the terminal open.

2. Open another terminal at at any machine in your LAN (possibly the
   same one as in the previous step) and run one or more seller agents
   with

       ./start-seller.sh host agentname

   where 'host' is the hostname of the machine running the main agent
   container and 'agentname' is the name of the agent (which should be
   unique by machine). 'localhost' and 's1' should work fine from the
   same machine running the main container.

   This command will display a dialog asking for the name and price
   of all the books that can be sold by that agent. Keep entering as
   many names and prices as you want.

3. Once all the books have been entered, open yet another terminal
   and run the buyer agent with

       ./start-buyer.sh host agentname bookname

   where 'host' and 'agentname' play the same roles as before, and
   'bookname' is the name of the book that the agent should get for
   as cheap as possible.

4. The buyer will ask the Directory Facilitator every minute for a list
   of all the sellers, and will ask them to sell the wanted book for a
   certain price. The price will slowly go up in time, and the agent will
   finish its execution as soon as one of the seller agents accepts the
   offer.

tl;dr
-----

1. ./start-main-container.sh

2. ./start-seller.sh localhost s1

3. Enter some books

4. ./start-buyer.sh localhost b1 MyBook

5. Wait a minute for the buyer to ask for the list of sellers
   and ask for a deal
